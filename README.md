# ðŸ“Œ Spiromed - Open-Source Spirometer

## ðŸ“– Overview
Spiromed is a project developed by students from the Electronic Engineering course at **UTFPR-TOLEDO**. It involves the development of a **low-cost spirometer** for preliminary examinations. The system consists of a **mobile application** and **embedded hardware** for real-time data acquisition and visualization. The mobile interface is developed using **MIT App Inventor**, while the **Arduino** processes sensor data.

## âœ¨ Features
- ðŸ“± **Android App** â€“ A user-friendly interface developed in **MIT App Inventor**.
- ðŸ“Š **Real-Time Data Visualization** â€“ View lung function parameters instantly.
- ðŸ”¬ **Embedded Firmware** â€“ Arduino-based code for sensor data processing.
- ðŸ”„ **Wireless Communication** â€“ Connects via Bluetooth for seamless data transfer.

â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ”§ espirometro.ino     # Arduino firmware
```

## ðŸ“² Installation & Usage
### ðŸ”¹ Android App
1. Download the latest **Espirometro1.0.2.apk**.
2. Install the APK on your Android device.
3. Open the app and pair it with the spirometer via Bluetooth.

### ðŸ”¹ Hardware Setup
1. Load the **espirometro.ino** firmware onto an **Arduino**.
2. Connect the required sensors and Bluetooth module.
3. Power on the device and ensure proper communication with the app.

## ðŸ”¬ How It Works
- **Venturi tube & pressure sensors** collect airflow data.
- **Arduino processes sensor readings** and transmits values via Bluetooth.
- **Mobile app** receives, processes, and displays results in real time.
